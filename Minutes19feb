The entire weight of the assembly will be around 1000g. 
Accordingly a motor with thrust for 800g with necessary propellers to be used.
The back up design is the same VTOL aircraft with another added control surface at the tail.
Before the next meet(29 Feb), the Juniors (mech) must learn XFLR5 along with SOLIDWORKS.
